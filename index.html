            <h2>History of Logarithms</h2>
            <p>Logarithms were introduced by John Napier in the early 17th century as a means to simplify calculations.
                The concept was further developed by Henry Briggs, who established the common logarithm (base 10) and
                refined the logarithmic tables.</p>
            <p>In the 18th century, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler made significant contributions to the theory
                of logarithms and their applications, particularly in the context of complex numbers and exponential
                functions.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Logarithms</h2>
            <p>A logarithm is the exponent to which a base must be raised to produce a given number. In other words, for
                a base <em>b</em> and a number <em>x</em>, the logarithm of <em>x</em> with base <em>b</em> is the
                number
                <em>y</em> such that <em>b<sup>y</sup> = x</em>.
            </p>
            <p>The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors:
                <em>log<sub>b</sub>(xy) = log<sub>b</sub>(x) + log<sub>b</sub>(y)</em>.
            </p>
            <p>The logarithm of a quotient is the difference of the logarithms:
                <em>log<sub>b</sub>(x/y) = log<sub>b</sub>(x) - log<sub>b</sub>(y)</em>.
            </p>
            <p>The logarithm of a power is the exponent times the logarithm of the base:
                <em>log<sub>b</sub>(x<sup>y</sup>) = y * log<sub>b</sub>(x)</em>.
            </p>
            <p>The logarithm of 1 is always 0: <em>log<sub>b</sub>(1) = 0</em>.</p>
            <p>The logarithm of the base itself is always 1: <em>log<sub>b</sub>(b) = 1</em>.</p>
            <p>To change the base of a logarithm: <em>log<sub>b</sub>(x) = log<sub>k</sub>(x) / log<sub>k</sub>(b)</em>.

        <section id="applications">
            <h2>Applications in Mathematics</h2>
            <p>Logarithms are used extensively in various fields of mathematics and science. They are essential in
                solving
                equations involving exponential growth or decay, such as population growth, radioactive decay, and
                interest calculations.</p>
            <p>In calculus, logarithms are used to integrate functions involving exponential terms. They also play a
                crucial role in the analysis of algorithms, particularly in computer science, where they help to
                determine the complexity of algorithms and data structures.</p>

                algorithms for calculating logarithmic values. Researchers are also exploring the use of logarithms in
                cryptographic systems and other advanced applications in computer science and engineering.</p>
